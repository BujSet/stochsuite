# TODO

## Random Number Generator Suite

* TODO: implement other RNGS:
    * Yarrow: https://www.schneier.com/academic/yarrow/
    * Fortuna: https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fortuna.pdf
    * PCGBasic: Seems to be broken... Need to fix
    * Parallel Random Number Generation: https://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf
    * HWRNG: should add check for x86_64 support for DRNG for graceful error message rather than program crash
    * Middle-squared method: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/generating-random-numbers.html

## Applications:

* TODO: add more apps
    * Monte Carlo McBeth Color Chart Approximator via Integration Approximation: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/monte-carlo-rendering-practical-example.html, https://github.com/scratchapixel/scratchapixel-code/blob/main/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/mcintegration.cpp, https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/monte-carlo-integration.html
