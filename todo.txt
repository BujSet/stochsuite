implementation of verilog version of RNGS - starts with Taus88
(all the states in one file (like RNGstate))
(treat task as mem block, read_value input coming in, just output entire 2d array)
(for writing, write to the first byte(lowest sigfig reg) for default)
!! has to be synthesizable, use flip flop to save numbers 


write a verilog tb to run the c code and compare it to the verilog output

tb (can be reused): instantiate with verilog, same seed of C file, and compare the output (suppose to hv same random number)
